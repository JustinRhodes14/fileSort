TESTPLAN - HOW WE MADE SURE IT WORKS

For this project, we ran our code through many different types of test cases. We tested at all stages of production, making sure all of our functions worked independently. At first, we tested to see if we could read bytes from the file properly, then we tested to see if we could store bytes in a linked list after every comma, and then we tested our comparator by comparing basic items. Lastly, we tested everything together when we completed our sorting functions. We tested long strings, negative numbers, empty strings in integer files, noise characters in both files, and empty strings in string files. Our code was able to compile for all of these, and handle very sizable words through testing. We were testing for segfaults or errors in storing the memory, and after all our tests, we concluded our file ran properly and handled all edge cases accordingly.
